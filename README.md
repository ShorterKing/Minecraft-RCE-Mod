# Minecraft Forge Mod: Command Execution PoC (Educational Use Only)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This is a proof-of-concept (PoC) Minecraft Forge mod for **educational and security research purposes only**. It demonstrates the risks of executing untrusted mods. **Do not use on systems without explicit permission or for malicious purposes.**

## üìñ Overview

This PoC mod illustrates how a Minecraft Forge mod can execute arbitrary system commands during initialization. When loaded in the `mods` folder, it triggers a harmless command to open the Windows Calculator (`calc.exe`) as a demonstration of code execution.

### üîç Purpose
- Raise awareness about the dangers of unverified mods in Minecraft.
- Highlight the lack of sandboxing in some mod loaders.
- Educate the modding and security communities on code execution risks.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical and Legal Considerations

### Ethical Guidelines
- **Informed Consent**: Only run this mod on systems you own or have explicit permission to test.
- **Transparency**: Never obfuscate or hide the mod‚Äôs behavior.
- **Educational Use**: Use only in controlled test environments for security demonstrations.
- **No Harm**: Do not use to deceive, exploit, or harm others.

### Legal Disclaimer
- This mod is provided **for educational and research purposes only**.
- The author is **not responsible** for any misuse, damage, or illegal activities caused by this code.
- Use and distribution are at your own risk, with **no warranties** provided.

## üîê Security Insights

This mod underscores critical security issues:
- **Untrusted Mods**: Blindly installing mods can lead to malicious code execution.
- **Mod Loader Vulnerabilities**: Forge‚Äôs lifecycle events allow mods to run arbitrary code without restrictions.
- **Attack Vectors**: Malicious mods could execute scripts, download payloads, or alter system files.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

During Forge‚Äôs mod initialization:
1. The mod hooks into the `FMLClientSetupEvent`.
2. It uses Java‚Äôs `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()` to run:
   ```java
   Runtime.getRuntime().exec("cmd /K calc");
   ```
3. On Windows, this opens the Calculator app as a visible proof of execution.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Risks
While this example is harmless, the same technique could:
- Execute malicious scripts.
- Download and run remote payloads.
- Modify or delete system files.

## üì¶ Installation (Test Environment Only)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Use only in a secure, isolated test environment!**

1. Install Minecraft with the appropriate Forge version.
2. Compile the mod and place the `.jar` file in the `mods` folder.
3. Launch Minecraft.
4. Observe the Calculator app opening as proof of command execution.

## üßë‚Äçüî¨ Responsible Use

### ‚úÖ Allowed Use Cases
- Security workshops or classroom demonstrations.
- Controlled testing in isolated environments.
- Educational content creation (e.g., blogs, videos).

### üö´ Prohibited Actions
- Distributing the mod in public modpacks or servers.
- Using it to deceive or harm users.
- Hiding the mod‚Äôs functionality or intent.

## üö® Final Warning

This PoC is **not a toy**. It exposes a real vulnerability in modded Minecraft setups. Use it to **educate and protect**, not to exploit.
